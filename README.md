# My Mood App
My Mood App is a small service that allows you to save information about your mood. Find out when and where you felt that wayâ€”the 'WHY' is up to you.

## 1. Overview
In this project, we explore some cool Javascripts functionalities, like API, Geolocation, POST requests, and so on.

## 2. Requirements

You need NodeJs and NPM installed. Also, since we are using [Weatherbit API](https://rapidapi.com/weatherbit/api/weather) to retrieve weather information, you must get an API_KEY and set it in a .env file.

## 3. Running the project:

First, you must create a .env file in the root directory and put a variable API_WEATHER_KEY with your key to Weatherbit API, as follows:

API_WEATHER_KEY=*YOUR_KEY_GOES_HERE*

Then, you should execute the following commands on a terminal (inside the project's root directory):
```
npm install
npm run dev
```
